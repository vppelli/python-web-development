# Python web development Learning Repo

# Directions For Me
- First I'll need to complete the pre-work section before you start my journey. Then, once I've begun learning, take my time after each Exercise to return to the Journal and respond to the prompts. 
- There will be 3 to 5 prompts per exercise, and I'll spend about 10 to 15 minutes answering them. I won't overthink it and write whatever comes to mind! 
- Make sure to keep the Journal up to date.

# Scope of my learning journey
- Understand Python.
- Create recipe apps using different operations.
- Learn Django and its benefits.
- Last project Create a Recipe app and have it hosted using Django.
