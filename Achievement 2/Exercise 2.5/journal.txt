Learning Goals

• Add images to the model and display them on the frontend of your application

Reflection Questions

1. In your own words, explain Django static files and how Django handles them.

2. Look up the following two Django packages on Django’s official documentation and/or other trusted sources. Write a brief description of each.
	ListView: List View refers to a view (logic) to display multiple instances of a table in the database. It streamlines the process by automatically handling the model, queryset, template, and context data. ListView simplifies the presentation of multiple database-backed lists in Django applications.

	DetailView: Detail View refers to a view (logic) to display one instances of a table in the database. It simplifies the process by handling the model, queryset, template, and context data automatically. DetailView presentation of a single detailed database table list in Django applications.

3. You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 2! Take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far. How is it going? What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something you’re struggling with? What do you need more practice with? You can use these notes to guide your next mentor call. 
	From the start to currently I am proud to say I really enjoyed learing python and Django. There are deffently some parts I need to improve on, as understanding ListViews and Detailviews a bit more. The structure of Django is strict and im starting to see this more, but I am getting better with each Exercise.
